        <h2>Dear Shifra,</h2>
        <h3>
            I remember the first time I saw you. I knew I wanted to be with you from the moment I laid eyes on you. 
            I couldn’t stop looking at you, your eyes, your smile – you stole my heart the first moment you spoke. 
            I first met you on the beach. I didn’t believe in love at first sight until I met you. And to this day, 
            I can’t believe you chose me to be with you. You’re everything I want as a partner and you’re mine. Don’t think for a minute that 
            I don’t appreciate everything you do for me. You’re everything to me and I love you.
            <b>The day I met you are the best day of my life.</b> You are my dream, and it’s a privilege to have you as my Girlfriend. 
            The joy you bring into my world is priceless. Nothing compares to it, and I am happy to have you. 
            When you think of me, I want you to imagine me as the luckiest guy in the world to have your love. 
            Never forget that I love you always.
            Hearing your <b>Voice</b> is the force that propels my body to jump in ecstasy. 
            While I cannot lower the love I have for you, 
            I want you to know that you are a fantastic woman that has won my heart just by being real. <br> <br>

            I know that I can’t give you the world, but I promise to hold on to you forever, 
            there is nothing that would give me greater joy than to see you happy always, 
            you are the best thing since God made man, forever you will be the queen of my heart, your love is everything to me. 
            The love you have given me is so special, my whole day is filled with thoughts of you, 
            falling in love with you is the best thing that ever happened in my life. <br> <br>

            I don't know if I can give you better love than you, but I believe I can give you that love. 
            I will be able to fulfill your expectations. I hope you forget your worries when you are with me. 
            I am madly in love with you because each time I think of you, my heart lights up with beautiful memories. 
            You are my true love, and I can’t stop thinking about you. <br> <br>

                Warms my heart to its core.<br>
                It’s hard to imagine<br>
                How I could love you more.<br>
                
                Just looking at you<br>
                Gives me a thrill.<br>
